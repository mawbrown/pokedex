# pokedex
This is a searchable pokedex for pokemon in the Kanto region (original 151 pokemon). You are able to either search pokemon by their number or their name. 
This will return both the pokemon's name and number as well as a picture of the pokemon. 
DOM manipulation is used to change the picture, number, and name of the pokemon displayed.
